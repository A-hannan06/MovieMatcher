# MovieMatcher

In this data science project, we built a content-based movie recommendation system using the TMDB movie dataset. The system recommends movies based on the similarity of their plot summaries, using the TfidfVectorizer and sigmoid kernel from scikit-learn to calculate the similarity scores. The project provides a good starting point for building more complex models and could be improved in the future by incorporating additional features and collaborative filtering.
